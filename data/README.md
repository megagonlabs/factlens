# CoverBench Dataset

We use the [Coverbench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/google/coverbench) dataset, as it compiles complex claims from various domains such as Wikipedia, Legal, Finance, and BioMedical. Claims from diverse sources of data helps us make fine-grained verification more generalizable. 

Run
```
$ pip install datasets
